		of concerts I have been to and concerts I hope to attend. 

		I am hoping to share my thoughts on the music I love. Athens 

		has such a rich and vibrant music scene and that has

		got to be my favorite part of the town. I will share 

		my past experiences attending concerts with an emphasis 

		on those in Athens. Additionally, I will share a list

		of concerts I hope to attend in the future.  </P></h2>
