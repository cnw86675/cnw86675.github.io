		<h2><p>This page is dedicated to my photos and thoughts 
		of concerts I have been to and concerts I hope to attend. 
		I am hoping to share my thoughts on the music I love. Athens 
		has such a rich and vibrant music scene and that has
		got to be my favorite part of the town. I will share 
		my past experiences attending concerts with an emphasis 
		on those in Athens. Additionally, I will share a list
		of concerts I hope to attend in the future.  </P></h2>

			This is one of my favorite concert</p>
			<p> photos I have taken because the lighting is very beautiful

			and the Business also played. It was one of </p><p>Tthe greatest shows I have been to and either of 
			these bands are definitely worth seeing if given a chance.</p></i></td>
